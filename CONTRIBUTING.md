## Contributing

Before you begin coding, please open an issue detailing your recommended fix or enhancement. 
I don't want you to waste your time working on something that doesn't end up getting merged. I am
pretty easy-going, so please, recommened anything you think is a good idea/fix!

All contributers are welcome.

1. First, fork the project.
2. Then, clone **your** forked project, replace `YOUR_USERNAME`, with well, your username:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/factory.git
```

3. Set `grahamsutton/factory` as your upstream:

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/grahamsutton/factory.git
```

4. Make your changes.
5. Add or update unit tests to cover at least all common/obvious scenarios (no tests, no merge).
6. Submit PR from `YOUR_USERNAME/factory` to `grahamsutton/factory`. Please include a short bullet point list summarizing the changes you made. Makes my life easier.
7. Discuss and make any recommended changes to code or formatting of code for your PR.
